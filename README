Note: when using flib with .swc's and on windows, you will need the 7-zip library installed.

Compilation from source requires 'caxe' to be installed (another of my github repos)

Alternatively, I keep unix/windows neko builds in the bin folder which can be compiled to binaries locally with:
	
	nekotools boot bin/flib_#.n
